                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may have guessed my name is Sean Beckstead and I'm a computer programmer. Currently I work for a school district as one of their Application Engineers. We primarily develop web based applications written in ColdFusion. There are some other projects involving C# including our Active Directory tool that pulls in information HR information and manages our Active Directory. Enough about work though, in my spare time I tend to be either playing games or developing them. I have started working with the Unity game engine as of recent and have really enjoyed it. I have created web friendly versions of some of my games and have posted them under my projects section. There will also be a link to an .apk as some games were intended Android. As far as the gaming is concerned Dota 2 has consumed most of my play time.

                    <h3>Mayhem Monkey</h3>
                    <p>Mayhem Monkey is a project being created for my CS 4750 Software Engineering course. I am working with a team of three other programmers and have been tasked with the handling the graphics. My other role has been implementing Git and teaching the rest of the team how to effectively use Git. The game play is quite easy, all you need to do is keep jumping on the bed and collecting bananas as they pass by. The challenge is dodging incoming objects like Ceiling fans which will knock you off course to land on the bed. Work in progress...</p>
